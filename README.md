# Digi-Wattmeter
Digital Wattmeter using Arduino Nano

There are number of ways that you can implement the Arduino Wattmeter. One of the easy ways is to interface a Voltage Sensor and a Current Sensor with Arduino, measure the voltage and current values and finally with some mathematics, you can calculate the Power in Watts.
Although using sensors can provide accurate results, where is the fun in using sensors if you can build the entire system yourself. This is beneficial if you are a student and trying to grab the underlying concepts.
